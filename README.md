# Church Overseer
- Make a .env file in the root directory and add `TOKEN` and `ROLE_ID` variables.
- Edit the `index.js` file and write your message at line 23.
- Start the overseer by `node .`
- Run the command `~~start` in any channel that bot has access too.
- Make sure all of the intents for the bot are enabled in the developer console.
- You can use this for many other purposes. This is going to grow and have it's own command for that but for now enjoy this.
